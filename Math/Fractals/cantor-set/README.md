# Cantor Set Interactive Visualizer

An interactive web visualization of the famous Cantor Set fractal, demonstrating its construction and mathematical properties.

## What is the Cantor Set?

The Cantor Set is a classic fractal created by repeatedly removing the middle third of line segments:

1. Start with a line segment from 0 to 1
2. Remove the middle third (leaving two segments)
3. Remove the middle third of each remaining segment
4. Repeat infinitely

## Key Mathematical Properties

- **Fractal Dimension**: 0.631 (between a point and a line)
- **Total Length**: Approaches zero as iterations increase
- **Number of Points**: Infinite (uncountably many)
- **Self-Similar**: Each piece looks like the whole set when scaled

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust iterations and animation speed
- **Real-time Animation**: Watch the Cantor Set construction step by step
- **Multiple Visualizations**: Main construction view plus analysis plots
- **Live Statistics**: Track segments, length, and fractal properties
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## How to Use

1. Use the iteration slider to see different construction levels
2. Click "Play Animation" to watch the automatic construction
3. Adjust speed for comfortable viewing
4. Observe how the statistics change with each iteration

## Mathematical Insights

This visualization helps understand:
- How fractals are constructed through iteration
- The relationship between dimension and scaling
- How infinite complexity can emerge from simple rules
- The paradox of zero length containing infinite points

Perfect for students learning about fractals, measure theory, or mathematical visualization techniques.
