# Theory and Methods 📚💻

Welcome! 🎉

This repository is a personal collection where I document various theoretical concepts, practical methods, and insights that I come across in my studies and projects. It’s a space where I note down anything that I find useful or thought-provoking, whether it’s **coding implementations** 💻, **markdown notes** 📝, or any other material that I think is worth recording.

The content will evolve as I continue to learn and explore new topics. It includes hands-on coding exercises 💡, personal notes 📖, and reflections on concepts or methods that I encounter during my learning journey.

Stay tuned for updates as I add new ideas, projects, and discoveries to this growing collection! 🌱🚀
